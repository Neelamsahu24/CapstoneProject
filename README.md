This project simulates a **real-time dynamic pricing system** for urban parking lots using data from 14 lots across 73 days. It models how prices should adapt based on **occupancy, vehicle type, queue length, traffic, special days,** and **nearby competitors** using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Pathway, and Bokeh.

## 📊 Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Missing values handled
  - Vehicle types encoded:
    - Car = 1.0, Bike = 0.5, Truck = 1.5
  - Features normalized: `OccupancyRate`, `QueueLength`

- **Model 1: Linear Pricing**
  - Formula: `Price_t+1 = Price_t + α * (Occupancy / Capacity)`
  - Acts as baseline model

- **Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing**
  - Demand calculated from weighted features:
    - Occupancy rate, queue length, traffic, special day, vehicle type
  - Price updated: `Price = BasePrice * (1 + λ * NormalizedDemand)`
  - Keeps prices between `0.5x` and `2x` base price

- **Model 3: Competitive Pricing (Optional)**
  - Uses **Haversine distance** to locate nearby lots
  - Price adjusted relative to **competition status**

## ⚙️ Real-Time Engine: Pathway

- Simulates data stream from CSV
- Uses `pw.apply()` to calculate demand and price on the fly
- Outputs include: FinalPrice, demand features

## 📈 Visualization: Bokeh

- Real-time line charts for top 5 most active parking lots
- X-axis: Time / Index  
  Y-axis: FinalPrice
- Helps justify price behavior over time

## 💡 Key Assumptions

- Trucks are willing to pay more than bikes/cars
- High traffic nearby decreases demand
- Special days boost demand
- Demand increases with occupancy & queue length
- Competitor pricing and availability influence price

## 🧠 Outcomes

- Developed 3 dynamic pricing models
- Real-time processing via Pathway
- Live visualization with Bokeh
- Prices are explainable, efficient, and fair
